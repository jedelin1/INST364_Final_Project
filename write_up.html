                        "Gone Phishing" is a simple web-based simulation of a phishing scheme. 
                        Users are presented with an email supposedly from their bank telling them 
                        that suspicious activity was detected on their account, and that they should 
                        sign into their account to remedy it. They can then either click the link or 
                        delete the email, and it is up to them to gauge the legitimacy of this email. 
                        They will be redirected to a page that gives information on why people fall for 
                        these attacks or how to avoid them using the NIST Cybersecurity framework depending 
                        on their choice. For those who know how to identify phishing attacks, it raises 
                        awareness of why they are still successful, and for those who do click the link, 
                        it provides information that should be helpful for avoiding real schemes.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In this digital age, most people are aware of phishing schemes and the signs that give 
                        them away (poor grammar, weird formatting, etc.), yet even highly educated people continue 
                        to fall for them, and there are several reasons for this. Many organizations collect highly 
                        personal information from people nowadays, but there are laws put in place that protect it 
                        from being sold or accessed by third-parties, making it difficult for hackers to steal it. 
                        However, phishers will gather data from publicly available sources, such as social media, 
                        marriage licenses, and census data, as a gateway to accessing more sensitive information. 
                        These scams prey on our emotions and instincts by using this personal data to craft believable 
                        messages from services we use and trust. We tend to view things more casually when we deem it as 
                        trustworthy, which can cause us to lower our guard and overlook some of the obvious signs of it 
                        being a scam, leading to a successful phishing attack.

                        There are, of course, also people who simply do not know better when it comes to phishing schemes, and 
                        sometimes that is because some groups cannot protect themselves. As explained by power structures, much 
                        of the current security measures in the U.S. exist to keep its white male founders at the top of the power 
                        hierarchy, with marginalized groups being put at a disadvantage. Immigrants in particular have been a popular 
                        target for hackers because they are often excluded from receiving information security. Law enforcement and 
                        the federal government often do things like target undocumented immigrants and restrict the type of research 
                        they can do. Phishers use this to their advantage by sending fake messages that promise the recipient will 
                        receive a favorable legal status or Green Card if they send money. Both of these things are highly sought 
                        after by many immigrants, and hackers are preying on their desires.

                        For those who need help understanding how to protect themselves from a phishing attack, they could follow 
                        the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework. This framework is made up 
                        of five core functions, being Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover, and although it is primarily 
                        meant for organizations, I believe it also has the potential to help at an individual level. The first function, 
                        identify, is where you take inventory of all your hardware and software, then develop an understanding of the 
                        potential threats and vulnerabilities they could face and establish cybersecurity policies and procedures that 
                        will protect your information. For phishing, this could mean taking into consideration that some emails may be 
                        sent to steal your information or infect your device with a virus, and installing a phishing detection browser 
                        extension for protection. The next stage, protect, is about developing and maintaining safeguards, which can 
                        include data encryption, regular security software updates, and training for cybersecurity risks. Detect involves 
                        the monitoring of your devices and investigation of unusual behavior. You should always check the legitimacy of 
                        any messages that seem unusual, especially when they are asking for high personal information or monetary 
                        compensation. Respond is about the actions that will be taken in the event of a security breach. In this case of 
                        a successful phishing attack, there are many things you could do depending on the type of attack. If it involved 
                        money, you should lock your bank account and report the event to your bank's official support team, and you may 
                        also want to use the experience to develop a better strategy for the future. Finally, there is Recover, where you 
                        restore any devices or software that may have been affected. All of these steps could work with each other as a 
                        guide for people to follow to protect their data.
