                    <p>
                        You may need help with protecting yourself against these cyber attacks, and a 
                        good way to keep your information safe is by following the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 
                        Cybersecurity Framework.

                    <p>
                        This framework is comprised of 5 components:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Identify: Take inventory of all your hardware and software, then develop an 
                        understanding of the potential threats and vulnerabilities they could face and 
                        establish cybersecurity policies and procedures that will protect your information.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Protect: Develop and maintain safeguards, which can include data encryption, 
                        regular security software updates, and training for cybersecurity risks.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Detect: Monitor your devices and investigate any unusual activity.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Respond: Decide what actions should be taken in the event of a security breach.
                    </p>

                    <p>
