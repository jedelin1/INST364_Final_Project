                        You've successfully identified that example as a phishing email
                        and thwarted the hacker's attack!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You should still be wary, as these attacks can still affect even the most knowledgeable 
                        of internet users. Hackers will use publicly available information about
                        us to craft believable emails that abuse our trust in a services. These can catch anyone
                        off guard, so it's always good to take caution when it comes to emails.

                        Some, however, do not have the luxury of privacy protection. Many security measures in the 
                        U.S. are designed to maintain the power of the industry's white male founders, leaving many 
                        marginalized groups at a disadvantage. Immigrants are in an especially position, as the 
                        government and law enforcement target them and restrict what they can research. This makes them
                        easy targets for phishers, who scam them by promising them a Green Card or favorable legal 
                        status.
